						Fierce Software is a small, woman-owned Value-Added Reseller.  Our strengths are in enterprise open-source solutions, primarily in secure platforms, DevOps, and Data Analytics.<br />
						Most of our customers are in the Public Sector, we deal directly with Federal System Integrators so the Prime Contractors that make the planes, trains, and automobiles. We work with them to put a lot of these logos together to do some really cool things.<br />
						We enable our customers with some of our value adds such as complimentary training, webinars, and workshops - we can deploy virtually, on-site, coast-to-coast in a single week.  We drop in with a lab, can work across Automation, Containers, DevOps, Security, and Data Science to name a few topics. We've done lunch and learns to certified 4-day team training campaigns so holler at us if you'd like to explore your own training and workshops.  You've got our social little bits there, we'll provide our contact information at the end as well.<br />
						Today we'll be focused on all things related to DevOps and Security.

							So I like boiling things down to the root cause - if you look at most of DevOps practices, tools, workflows you get a few key tenants.<br />
							Your Git repo is going to be your best friend - from infrastructure deployment scripts, documentation, applications of course, and more.<br />
							Rapid feedback to constantly learn and better processes with indepth monitoring is how you make your workflows more effective.<br />
							We're now using immutible systems and not SSH'ing into machines to fix because it's easier and faster to debug and redeploy since the application is always releasable, powered by an automated pipeline.

							So what's funny about it, once the fighting settles down and we're cheers-ing at the bar, we all say we want the same core things - right?<br />
							We want stability, we want security, we want the assurance that we're not going to be called at 3AM when a system is down.  We want to not spend hours or days to weeks on root cause analysis, debugging, maintenance, or procurement.  Distill it down more and we all just want to go home at 5 knowing we did a good days work without risk of a fire as soon as you turn your back.

							The Hadoop ecosystem can trace its roots back to the early days of the Internet and everything we know and use today.<br />
							In 1997, Doug Cutting started working on the first version of what would become Apache Lucene, a full-text search library.  It's what powers the sub-second query results that you expect from Google.  Great, with fast search, we can now inspect data.<br />
							With the help of Mike Cafarella, Doug created what is now Apache Nutch, a crawler, spider, or otherwise a data-scraping robot.  They started to literally crawl the entire Internet, and with Lucene were able to search across everything crawled almost instantly.<br />
							As you may assume, crawling and searching the entire Internet is a larger order.<br />
							It was around 2002 where they started to experience scalability issues and started to design a system in software that was schemaless, durable and self-healing, and could be deployed on commodity hardware.<br />

							Around this time, Google releases their specification for Google File System which solved many of the issues Doug and Mike were facing so they set to implement it in Java and thus the Nutch Distributed File System was born.<br />
							Now that these projects could tackle the task of crawling, searching, and storing large quantities of data, there was the challenge of processing this data in a distributed fashion.  Most other solutions would transport the data to a large computational engine and then ship the results out.  At this sort of scale that was unfeasible.

							Enter MapReduce, by Jeffery Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat (Gimma-watt).  MapReduce solved parallelization, distribution, and fault-tollerance by Mapping parts of a job to all nodes, and then Reducing slices of the work back down to the final results.<br />
							Around this time, the different projects were moved from sub-projects of the Lucene organization, into a new Hadoop ecosystem which consisted of Hadoop Common, HDFS, and MapReduce.<br />
							Hadoop started to pick up steam, enough to where Yahoo! (if anyone remembers them) replaced their legacy C++ based search engine with Hadoop and within 6 months were running a 1000-node cluster in production.  How could a Java program replace a robust C++ system?  Surprisingly it did so with relative ease.

							An EDC must solve an enterprises most pressing data and analytic challenges in a streamlined fashion. Addressing real-world business problems generally requires the application of multiple analytic functions working together on the same data - it's not just one magic model running on one data set that will get you what you need. For example, autonomous vehicles require the application of both real-time data streaming and machine learning algorithms.<br />
							Something that is absolutely critical is that an EDC has to be secure and compliant, meeting the strict data privacy, governance, data migration and metadata management demands of large enterprises across all their environments.<br />

							In case you have a high volume of data to manage and stream, CDF can respond to millions of events a second with data of almost any size imaginable.  Governance policies and life cycles are managed easily from the same secure and end-to-end encrypted drag-and-drop UI that you build your flows in, and if there isn't a stream processor already available in the expansive catalog it's rather easy to create one.

							You have more than the Web UI as an interface, flows and their components are stored as files and can be edited manually or produced as part of an automation pipeline.  With the version control offered by the registry in CDF, you can apply the same DevOps and CI/CD workflows that your other development teams benefit from.

							 CDF can offer more than just streaming of data, it can offer a way to govern the movement and weight of your data through your enterprise.  This allows you to not only stream, transform, aggrigate, and enrich streaming data but also ensures that it only arrives at its intended destination.

							 Now, CDF is what helps Cloudera tackle the Edge to AI.  With Minifi, you can stream data from small IoT devices at and beyond the edge.  This can fit on megar IoT and Single Board Computing devices such as the original Raspberry Pi, to more hardened and weather proof real-time OS driven embedded sensors.

					<section data-transition="fade" data-background="/img/events/cloudera_webinar/clouderaKeyChallenges.png" data-background-size="cover">
						<aside class="notes">
							 Now as you're streaming this data in and out of your data lakes and in-between your edge devices, you'll run into some common problems.  Some streaming solutions require you to move your data somewhere, store it in a specific way, in order to be used which wastes a lot of costly resources and most importantly - time.  Often this is time-series based data so the information is more crucial at the time of inception, which means your insights and analytics programs are operating after the fact instead of being able to respond immediately.  And if you've got all that tacked then I'm sure you know and see every piece of data moving through your enterprise, right?
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="fade" data-background="/img/events/cloudera_webinar/clouderaStreamProcessing.png" data-background-size="cover">
						<aside class="notes">
							 The solutions offered in CDF actually do tackle those challenges.  With Kafka you have a robust and scalable Publisher/Subscriber queue that can respond to millions of streams.  Apache Storm allows you to act and process upon those streams in real time while the data is still in flight without needing to offload, store, and aggrigate onto a compute cluster.  With the Streams Messaging Manager and the Streaming Analytics Manager you gain the ability to not only see the streams going through your system and their associated properties but you can analyze and visualize thoses streams as well.  The Schema Manager extends powerful access and version control to the key components that make up your flow and provides a collaborative CI/CD workflow to accellerate your data campaigns.

							 Outside of the technology stack, a few things that set apart CDF is the assurance of Cloudera's 100% dedication to Open Source.  As I mentioned before, there are a bevy of built-in stream processors, the number of which has almost doubled in the last 2 years due to the drive of the community and how easy it is to create new data processors that can work across multiple streaming analytics engines, with governance and management policies baked in.

							Welcome to the next generation data platform from Cloudera.
							A single management plane to orchestrate, operate, and secure your whole platform, no matter if it's in the cloud, multiple clouds, on-premise, and even right down to the edge devices.
							Cloudera's SDX, or Shared Data Experience, is a part of this platform that unifies data management for all your data and presents it with a stateful context that defines the security, governance, cataloging, and lifecycle polcies around the various data endpoints.  This presents you with a data catalog that allows you to apply multi-disciplinary analytic models no matter where your data is.
							In the middle of this stack sandwich, we have the core functions that comprise the Enterprise Data cloud, be that streaming, manipulating, storing, accessing and analyzing, and creating new ML models, all on an open-source platform.

						<aside class="notes">
							The merger of the two platforms from Cloudera and Hortonworks brought together some amazing technologies, but also presented some overlap.<br />
							A few of the noteworthy and most asked about changes - moving forward Cloudera will support the very user-friendly Cloudera Manager, Ranger will keep security checks in line, CloudBreak has been selected for automated and multi-cluster managed cloud deployments, and Hive on Tez is being promoted for it's rich integration with the YARN architecture.<br />
							Looking at the charts you can see that we're greatly benefiting from the merger of these platform since most changes are due to their merging of similar technologies into a more powerful but simpler stack, or integrating complementary technologies.  You'll be happy to know that you can run your Clouder Data Science Workbench Jobs right next to your Zeppelin Notebooks.<br />
							Now, does this mean that if you were operating the previous Cloudera stack, do you need to rip and replace your Cloudera Director with CloudBreak managed clusters?  Or if you were running a Hortonworks platform do you need to retool around Cloudera Manager immediately?  The answer is no, Cloudera is dedicated to supporting these softwares for a few years to come as their customers carve out their upgrade strategies.<br />

					<section data-transition="fade" data-background="/img/events/cloudera_webinar/clouderaNewFormFactor.png" data-background-size="cover">
						<aside class="notes">
							 So there's a slight change in form-factor and overarching architecture with the new Cloudera EDC.<br />
							 As you saw from the screenshot earlier, the new EDC will feature a unified management control plane that's offered as a hosted service by Cloudera.  If you are operating in a secure enclave, don't worry - there are options for disconnected environment as well.<br />
							 It's through this new management console that you'll not only access your data, but also where you'd instanciate your Data Warehouses, Jobs and ML models, Data Engineering services and more.<br />
							 SDX is the glue that brings your various data lakes together, and of course this can be run across any supported public cloud provider.

					<section data-transition="fade" data-background="/img/events/cloudera_webinar/clouderaPrivateCloudFormFactor.png" data-background-size="cover">
						<aside class="notes">
							If you're not using a Public Cloud providers and are still working on premises or want to include these resources in your EDC, Cloudera offers a wide array of options.<br />
							As we've seen the industry adopt containers and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, Cloudera has also developed a scalable architecture on Kubernetes so that your services and workloads can be scaled up and down, out and in, all on demand.<br />
							Now, you can run this on your own Kubernetes platform, or take the "batteries included" approach where Cloudera provides you with exactly what you need, with the Kubernetes sort of baked in, to quickly get up and running.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="fade" data-background="/img/events/cloudera_webinar/clouderaOnePlatform.png" data-background-size="cover">
						<aside class="notes">
							The use of Kubernetes as the underlying platform allows Cloudera's EDC to scale and run on any cloud or environment without the need to manage different hypervisors, images, and so on.<br />
							As Cloudera and Hortonwork's product catalogs and development road maps have converged, we now have the ability to run a unified data platform across our various environments and use a single management console to operate all of your EDC, governance, policies, and workloads enacted on any and all of your data, with the peace of mind knowing that you're operating a 100% open-source data platform that keeps you free from vendor lock-in or relying on cloud-specific APIs and services.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="fade" data-background="/img/events/cloudera_webinar/clouderaFutureDataArch.png" data-background-size="cover">
						<aside class="notes">
							So what should you look for and keep in mind when sizing your own EDC?<br />
							Being able to interact with your data workflows as you would in traditional DevOps practices is key, but your platform components and workloads also need the ability to atomically scale and upgrade.<br />
							Try to steer clear of products and platforms that rely on one vendor, platform, and specific closed environments or ecosystems.  This keeps you from vendor lock-in and also allows you to deploy your data and workloads where cost and resources are most opportune.<br />
							Jumping in and out of control panels, different technologies that don't interoperate fluidly, and a lack of automation is what we're already faced with - a unified solution that can intelligently catalog, govern, and secure your EDC is paramount in being able to get up to speed and stay at that pace.<br />

							DevOps as a base has been slow moving in the Public Sector - DevSecOps practices and embedded security considerations is making big strides, in some places across entire agencies at large, offered as a service.<br />
							So this means that you've got the documentation, processes, workflow down, and with the right enablement you can have new developers and operators sit down and work with production-level systems in a few hours.<br />
							Wait, does this mean I've kind of used Git, documentation, container platforms, and automation to quickly train and upskill new, current, and transitional team members?  Yup!<br />
							As you get to this we're now not dreading this ATO process - it's something that's operationalized, and a step closer to that ATO or Contracts as a Service idea everyone's starting to formulate.<br />
							I think probably the most important point is that it keeps us ahead of the competition - we can see the effects of DevSecOps practices by other large organizations and nation states abroad.  This technological agility has been the "make or break" differenciator between commercial entities and it's soon a time where we'll see the same effects on government at large.
